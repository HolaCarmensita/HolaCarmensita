## 💻 Tech Stack & Tools

I enjoy working mostly on the **frontend** with JavaScript, learning TypeScript and LOVE React, but I’m also exploring the **backend** side with Node.js and Express. Also been very into **accessibility (WCAG)** lately and love to continue working on that area. Code is made for us all! 

On the design side, I’ve got a background in **UX and digital design**, which helps me bridge the gap between design and development.  

Some of the tools and frameworks you’ll often see me use:  
- React 
- Node.js & Express  
- HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of design magic 🎨  
- Git & GitHub for version control  
- VSCode as my go-to editor  

I’m always curious to try new tools, but these are the ones that feel like home right now. 🚀
