# 👋 Hello, I’m Casandra (a.k.a. Carmencita)

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I’m a passionate developer based in Eskilstuna, Sweden, on a journey to build, learn, and hopefully soon share something useful. 💡

## 💻 Tech Stack & Tools

I enjoy working mostly on the **frontend** with JavaScript, learning TypeScript and LOVE React, but I’m also exploring the **backend** side with Node.js and Express. Also been very into **accessibility (WCAG)** lately and love to continue working on that area. Code is made for us all! 

On the design side, I’ve got a background in **UX and digital design**, which helps me bridge the gap between design and development.  

Some of the tools and frameworks you’ll often see me use:  
- React (and soon I can put TypeScript here)
- Node.js & Express  
- HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of design magic 🎨  
- Git & GitHub for version control  
- VSCode as my go-to editor  

I’m always curious to try new tools, but these are the ones that feel like home right now. 🚀

## 🌟 Fun Facts / Personal Passions

- 📚 I love **learning by building and reading** — plan to tackle small projects as soon as this bootcamp i'm on is done 🤓 
- The perfect coding environment = complete silence… right after a good run 🏃‍♀️💻  
- I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and always improving  
- I love climbing, running and eat to much candy 


Thank you for stopping by my GitHub! Chao! 😊
